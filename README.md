Assembly language is a low-level programming language that uses human-readable mnemonics to represent the basic instructions of a computer's machine code. It has a very strong correspondence to the machine code for a specific processor architecture, making it ideal for tasks that require direct hardware control, such as writing device drivers, operating system kernels, and embedded systems
